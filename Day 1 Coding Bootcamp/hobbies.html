        <p>I enjoy doing many things with my spare time. I don't have much spare time, but when I do, I enjoy doing the following activities. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ceramics</li>
            <li>Oil Painting</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Eating Tasty Foods</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why do I enjoy these things?</h3>

        <p>
            For me, art, food, culture, and travel are what life is all about.

        <p>
            Painting and ceramics gives me a creative outlet to make beautiful, interesting, and unique pieces. Not only does it help relieve stress, it also helps activate my brain's creative thinking abilities and muscle memory. I feel like I'm in a complete state of flow when I'm painting or doing ceramics. I'm not thinking about my job, my chores, or any of my typical daily worries. When I'm creating, the world and its problems disappear. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Eating and traveling unlock a feeling of freedom for me. I'm absolutely elated whenever I'm about to takeoff on a flight to someplace new or about to take my first bite of a much-awaited food item (usually involving pasta or seafood). I'm never more joyful than when I get to try gourmet foods or travel to a new city, beach, or town.
