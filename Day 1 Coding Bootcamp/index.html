  <h1>My Name is Kate Hirschfelt.</h1>

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
  <p>
      Hello World! My name is Kate and I live in Truckee, CA. I currently work as a Jr. Interior Designer at a company called Tahoe Modern. It's my first big move since attending college at UC Davis, and my first time living in a place where it snows a <em>lot</em>. I'm excited to start this journey which marks a huge milestone in my growth as a human! <strong>But</strong> I'm also super nervous to live in such a rugged place, full of snow, ice, bears, and wildfires. With any luck I'll come out stronger and wiser #TruckeeStrong.

  <h3>Three Fun Facts About Me</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>I am adopted from China</li>
    <li>I am a huge foodie</li>
    <li>I really enjoy growing and propogating succulents (and I did it before it was cool)</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>So Why Does This Page Exist?</h3>
 <p>
     The reason that I'm creating this page is to practice working with HTML. I used to really struggle with coding, and I thought that I had absolutely no future in it, but I want to give it another try because front-end developers and UI/UX designers do some really cool things through coding. Seeing amazing websites and portfolios inspires me to learn how to code. Maybe one day I will be able to code a really rad website for my art, design, or ceramics projects. It would also be fun to have a job which involves coding because the pay is good, you can work remotely, <em>and</em> it's flexible.
